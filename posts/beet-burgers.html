<p>Before I get to the beet burgers I will start off by saying, I’m really not good at this whole blogging thing. To be completely honest, I didn’t really expect the whole process to be as time consuming as it has turned out to be. By “the whole process,” I really do mean a whole process. This whole process involves quite a few steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The idea inception phase. Sometimes I have more ideas than others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once I have a great idea, finding the time to execute this great idea becomes a challenge. As I may have previously mentioned, I have a full-time job.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Testing out a recipe and shooting the whole process. Believe it or not, taking photos is a lot more time consuming (for me, at least) than it may seem. I would say that pretty much anything I cook takes about twice as long when there’s a camera involved. Additionally, there’s the time of the year to factor in. Natural daylight produces better images but because it’s winter, I can only take advantage of daylight hours over the weekend when I don’t work (sun sets ~5 PM).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quality control. Let’s say I had a great idea, great light, and great photos. At that point, I just have to hope the final product is just as great. I’ve actually taken photos of recipes in the past but haven’t shared because I didn’t think they tasted great.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, editing and posting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not trying to throw myself a pity party over here. Just know that I’m working on it and I haven’t forgotten about this space.</p>
<p>Now… to the beet burgers. I’m sure by now you’ve gathered I’m a vegetarian. Actually, I’m (an almost full-time) vegan. I don’t like to say I’m a full-time vegan because I’m pretty sure I unknowingly eat traces of egg and milk (hidden ingredients in a lot of food) here and there that I don’t know about but for the most part, I try my best to stick to a vegan diet. Now, I’m not here to tell you why should be a vegetarian yourself or anything like that. My only hope is that these recipe posts inspire you to incorporate more plant-based recipes into your day-to-day. This recipe specifically was inspired by a beet burger I had last week at a local Denver restaurant . Beets weren’t exactly something I ate a whole lot of until recently that my husband and I moved from Texas to Colorado. Beets seem to be much more popular over here and I’m definitely not complaining. This beet patty has a great smoky tasty and is pretty easy to make. {Scroll down for full recipe.}</p>

<li>Form 2-3 inch patties and place over parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the top of the patties with olive oil and place in over for approximately 25-30 minutes. Remove patties about halfway through and flip. Recipe yields 8-10 patties. *</li>
<li>Allow patties to cool down for a few minutes after removing from the oven.</li>
<li><p>Assemble burgers with garnishes of choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can alternately cook these over the stove. Cook in pan with a little bit of olive oil for a few minutes until patties reach desired color.</li>
