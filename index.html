      <h1>My favorite breading method featuring sweet n’ sour tofu rice bowls</h1>
<p><img src="2020-04-29-SweetAndSourTofu/TofuHeader.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>About once a year, I hop back on here and say something like “I’m back for good!” I admit it, I’m not consistent on here but still hope to be one day. Given how 2020 is shaping up to be, this could be the year! A lot has happened since my last post on here, but those are all stories for another day (i.e., we’re back in Texas, we adopted a sweet stray pup, and we’ve been spending at least a good solid 22 hours a day inside our 1 bedroom apartment for the last five weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic, etc.). It’s only April and what a year it has been already.</p>
<p>Like many of you, we suddenly have quite a bit of extra time on our hands lately. I’d hate to pretend or give the impression that this is what every day for the last five weeks has been looking like for us. Somedays I cook a lot, somedays I’m just overwhelmed by everything that is happening and all the uncertainty around me, other days I manage to not think much about it. But again, that’s for another day.</p>
<p>Today I’m sharing a my all-time favorite breading method. This breading method, that is meant to be used in place of “battering and deep frying,” was about eight to nine years in the making. It kinda started when I first became a vegetarian circa 2011 and I discovered Wheatsville Co-op’s buffalo popcorn tofu in Austin Texas. Y’ALL… many years later, I’m still so in love with that stuff. To make a long story short, from the moment I tasted Wheatsville’s popcorn tofu, I became obsessed with both the tofu and recreating the recipe. There was a lot of trial and error, sometimes the flavor was right but the consistency and texture just wasn’t and other times I nailed the texture but the flavor was all wrong. Throughout this process I also realized that I also don’t enjoy deep frying things at home. It’s messy, it leaves your kitchen smelling like McDonald’s for days, and while I do still love a good french fry, I prefer to leave the fried goods for those times that we eat out from restaurants instead (ignorance is bliss, am I right?!). Same reason why I don’t think I’ll ever own a deep fryer.</p>
<p>To clarify, today I’m not sharing my recreation of the Wheatsville popcorn tofu, but rather, my gained knowledge from years of relentlessly trying to recreate it. Although we use a sweet n’ sour sauce for this recipe, you can swap that out for pretty much any pre-made sauce from the grocery store (we like to use peanut sauce sometimes). Also note that this breading method isn’t just great for tofu, it works amazing on butternut squash, sweet potatoes, eggplant, cauliflower, etc. I will also warn you that it is a bit time consuming and a little messy so I would recommend doing a lot at once (economies of scale… since you’re going through the hassle already) and freezing a portion of the breaded tofu or vegetables before coating in any sauce. Once you’re ready bake, move from the freezer to the refrigerator to thaw overnight, stick in the oven a few minutes to warm up and make sure the inside isn’t frozen, and then pickup at the sauce coating step. So let’s get started!</p>
<p><img src="2020-04-29-SweetAndSourTofu/TofuPlates.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Sweet n’ Sour Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 tbs arrowroot powder (or cornstarch powder) mixed with 2 tbs water</li>
<li>3 tsp sesame oil (or vegetable oil)</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1 tsp fresh ginger, grated</li>
<li>½ tsp red pepper flakes</li>
<li>½ c white vinegar (regular, white wine, or rice vinegar)</li>
<li>¾ c water</li>
<li>⅔ c maple syrup (or honey, agave nectar, sugar)</li>
<li>3 tbs tomato paste</li>
<li>3 tbs soy sauce (or tamari, coconut aminos)</li>
<li>½ tsp sea salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breaded Tofu</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 14 oz block of extra firm tofu</li>
<li>½ c unsweetened plain almond milk (or milk of choice, just make sure it’s plain and unsweetened)</li>
<li>¾ c all purpose flour (or gluten-free flour)</li>
<li>1 ½ c breadcrumb mixture, ¾ c panko crumbs + ¾ c plain breadcrumbs (or gluten-free breadcrumb alternatives)</li>
<li>extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Serving (optional)</h3>
<ul>
<li>rice</li>
<li>roasted vegetables of choice (we used carrots and broccoli)</li>
<li>cilantro, chopped</li>
<li>green onions</li>
<li>soy sauce</li>
<li>sriracha sauce</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<h3>Sweet n’ Sour Sauce</h3>
<ol>
<li>Mix the the arrowroot powder and cornstarch and set aside.</li>
<li>In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes and stir until fragrant and being careful not to burn the garlic or ginger (about 30 seconds to a minute).</li>
<li>Add in the remaining sauce ingredients and whisk together over medium heat until just bubbling. Then whisk in the cornstarch and water mixture. Whisk frequently for 10 to 12 minutes until thickened and reduced. Remove from the heat and set aside while you bread and bake the tofu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Breaded Tofu</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 425 °F.</li>
<li>Prepare the tofu: Drain and gently press excess moisture from tofu over a kitchen sink. I find that freezing the tofu when I buy it and then moving it to the refrigerator the night before I use, changes the consistency of the tofu  in a way that makes it easier to squeeze that extra moisture without falling apart (freezing the tofu almost gives it a “sponge-like” consistency). Slice the tofu into 1-inch cubes.</li>
<li>Breading: In three separate bowls, place 1) the flour 2) the plain almond milk and 3) the breadcrumb mixture. First, coat each piece of tofu evenly with flour by pressing each side of the tofu into the flour bowl. Second, dip each piece of flour-coated tofu into the almond milk bowl so that the outside of the tofu becomes sticky and tacky (be careful not to submerge for too long or the flour will just fall off). Third, transfer the sticky tofu cube into the breadcrumb bowl and, with a spoon, press the breadcrumbs to coat the tofu evenly. The mixture of panko and plain breadcrumbs is what will help us achieve an even and crispy coat.</li>
<li>Bake: Place the breaded tofu on a parchment lined baking sheet and lightly drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 20-25 minutes. About halfway through the baking time, flip each piece and drizzle with olive oil again and bake for the remaining time (or until lightly browned at the edges – see middle image below). Take the tofu out of the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes and, using a silicon brush, evenly brush the sweet n’ sour sauce evenly on each piece. You can also take a spoon and submerge a few pieces of tofu at a time into the saucepan and transfer back to the baking sheet. Place back in the oven and bake for no more than 5 minutes – be careful not to burn the sauce. This extra steps allows the sauce to really stick to the tofu and creates that crispy texture (see third image below). Remove from oven and allow to tofu to cool over the baking sheet before serving.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can serve these over a bed of rice and roasted or stir fried vegetables. We topped with coconut aminos (a great  low sodium soy sauce alternative), sriracha sauce, cilantro, green onions, and a squeeze of lime.</li>
<li><p>This method is very versatile and works on a number of things in place of deep frying. I’ve used this method to bread butternut squash for tacos, on cauliflower to make buffalo bbq cauliflower “wings,” on eggplant to make eggplant parmesan, etc.</p>

<h1>Everything minus the bagel seasoning</h1>
<p><img src="2019-01-31-Bagels/BagelHeader.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It wasn’t until November of last year that I would’ve quite confidently told you that bagels simply weren’t my thing. I was of the opinion that there was way too much chewing involved with a reward that just wasn’t worth the strenuous jaw work. Dramatic, I know. All that was before we arrived at the airport that Wednesday before Thanksgiving of last year. My husband, having a profound love for bagels that I never quite understood, suggested we grab a quick bite before boarding our flight. We stopped at a small shop with muffins, cookies, and bagels. I went ahead and ordered the usual, a whole wheat bagel. We found a place to sit by our gate to sit down and eat our meal before boarding the plane. As I was chewing through my own bagel I couldn’t help but catch a savory whiff of whatever Andrew was chewing on. To my own surprise, I asked if I could have a bite of what turned out to be an everything bagel – and there was no turning back.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my world was flipped upon taking that first bite from an everything bagel. Now I understood what all the bagel hype was about. From that moment onward, it’s as if I needed to make up for all that lost time and have all the uneaten everything bagels I’d forgone. This revelation came to me at a time when I was approximately two weeks away from a big exam and if you’re anything like me, studying makes you hungry (even five minutes after you just ate!) simply because the mind wants to procrastinate. My addiction grew quickly and I was having two, or sometimes three, bagels a day. I told myself that once my exam was over, I couldn’t be having multiple bagels a day. This was a real problem.</p>
<p>We are now past my exam and the bagels had to go cold turkey. That is what inspired this post. In desperate search for an alternative (or need to fill that void), I remembered hearing about Trader Joe’s everything but the bagel seasoning. It’s genius if you ask me but unfortunately, the nearest TJ’s is pretty out of the way from where I live. After some research I quickly realized that this seasoning is simply a mixture of relatively easy to find ingredients from any grocery store. My favorite way to have this is sprinkled over avocado toast but I’m sure it’s just as tasty over a salad. Let me know if you try this and any creative ways in which you use this seasoning. Enjoy!</p>

<h1>This is the new year</h1>
<p>With the start of every new year, there’s a surge of excitement that rushes through me as I crack open the spine of a new planner. There’s an optimistic and hopeful energy that fills the air those first few days of every new year. There’s something truly special about having the opportunity to start fresh, set high hopes and dreams, and put your best foot forward alongside everyone around you as you each tackle a new year and pursue your own best version of you. For me, it’s not just a new year but also the beginning of a new age as I celebrate my own birthday mid-January.</p>
<p>With setting goals and expectations for the upcoming year, there is an inherent sense of reflection on the successes and failures of the last 365 days. This year, in laying out my intentions for 2019, I’m choosing to give myself grace. Rather than critiquing my failures and shortcomings of the last year, I want to continue to look forward and focus on the promising potential of the new year and age that lie ahead of me.</p>
<p>This year I have also decided to keep things simple by only laying out my broad intentions for the year rather than trying to get specific. I’m sure there are plenty of self-help books out there that would find that last statement controversial and a recipe for disaster for any individual trying to realistically set and achieve their goals. However, if you’re anything like me, your list of New Year’s resolutions typically starts off looking something like: eat healthy, exercise more, go to bed earlier every night… clean the pantry, etc., and before you know it, you’re looking at something that looks a lot more like a long and dreadful to-do list.</p>
<p>While I do have specific goals in mind and plans for achieving those goals in the upcoming year, I want my intentions for 2019 to serve as a kind and gentle reminder of themes and areas in my life that I continually want to improve on for the years to come – things that I will never quite master perfection in but will instead attempt to find a good balance in. Here are my intentions for the upcoming year:</p>
<p>GO OUTSIDE AND ENJOY THE DAY – Whether it’s a short walk, a hike, or week-long camping trip, there’s nothing I find more refreshing than breathing in some fresh air. As much as I enjoy the outdoors, it’s not uncommon for me to sometimes go whole days without really stepping outside for any longer than a few minutes. I want to be better at finding reasons to spend time outside and less time sitting in front of a computer.</p>
<p>KEEP AN OPEN MIND – I spent a lot of time last year studying for a big exam and not a lot of time reading books simply out of enjoyment. While I don’t want to abandon my studying, I hope to make more time to read books I enjoy reading, learn something new, or take a fun class. This year I’m excited to spend some extra time bringing to life my mental vision for this website!</p>
<p>STRIVE FOR A SUSTAINABLE &amp; HEALTHY ROUTINE – I’m still trying to find a routine that’s a good harmony of exercising regularly, eating healthy, getting enough rest, etc. It seems like there are moments in my life where I’m really good at one but not so great at another. My intention here is to find a routine that marries all the various pieces together and feels right and sustainable for me.</p>
<p>SLOW DOWN &amp; EBRACE UNCERTAINTY – The older I get, the faster time seems to get away from me. I used to think that everything, or at least most things in my life, were things within my control scheduled to fall into place according to my own timeline. I have come to find that, as a general rule, I am not in full control of my circumstances and future. However, I am in control of how I show up to those circumstances and I can choose to show up in the discomfort of the unknown and still savor and enjoy the moment rather than fixating on self-imposed timelines.</p>
<p>DON’T FORGET TO BE GRATEFUL – With the hustle and bustle of everyday responsibilities and commitments, it’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and forget how blessed our lives really are. I want to make the extra effort to think about the blessings in my life, let those around me know that I’m seeing their acts of kindness, and remember to say “thank you.”</p>
<p>LET GO OF PERFECTION AND SHOW YOURSELF GRACE – I am, without a doubt, my own worst critic. While I don’t think I’ll relinquish my perfectionist tendencies over night, sometimes I need a kind reminder that “good enough is good enough” and there is no such thing as finishing everything on one’s to-do list and that’s perfectly okay. Instead of focusing on the things that were left undone at the end of the day, I want to focus on the things that were accomplished and remember that tomorrow is a new day.</p>
<p>Happy 2019! What are some of your goals for the new year? If you had to choose just one thing to focus on, what would it be?</p>

<h1>Rice krispie treats</h1>
<p><img src="2017-02-05-RiceKrispy/RiceKrispy1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In my book, the real reason Valentine’s Day is even a holiday is because we all needed a good excuse to break our New Year’s resolution diets. What better way of doing so than in the name of love? Am I right!? Speaking of New Year’s resolutions – it is mine to create more blog content and post more often than twice a year! (Check out the post right before this one, dated from almost a year ago.)</p>
<p>If you haven’t already gathered, I have a sweet tooth. In fact, one of the most exciting things to me upon embarking this vegan journey (not sure what else to call it) was discovering new ways to create sweet treats that were just as delicious as their non-vegan counterparts. I’ve always really enjoyed coming across recipes of people making ‘knock-offs’ (I mean that as a compliment!) of store bought treats in their own kitchen (think Little Debbie snacks, Nutter Butters, etc.). I love thinking up of ways of veganizing dishes I enjoyed from my pre-vegetarian days. Well, these treats are just that kind of fun – they’re the veganized knock-off of the Kellogg’s Rice Krispie treat!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 10 oz bag of vegan marshmallows (I used Dandies Marshmallows, can be found at Whole Foods. Sub regular marshmallows if not vegan.)</li>
<li>5 c crisp rice cereal</li>
<li>2 tbs vegan butter (such Earth Balance or Smart Balance)</li>
<li>2 tbs coconut oil + ½ tbs for melting chocolate chips</li>
<li>1 c vegan semisweet chocolate chips (optional, for coating)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a microwave safe bowl, combine marshmallows, butter, and coconut oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stir between each microwave. Repeat until marshmallows are fully melted. (You can also do this over the stove using a saucer pan. In a saucer pan over medium heat, combine marshmallows, butter, and coconuts oil. Stir until marshmallows are completely melted.)
M- ix in cereal and combine mixture until all the cereal is evenly coated with the marshmallow mixture.</li>
<li>Press mixture into a 9″ X 9″ pan. Once cool, cut into squares or into desired shapes using a cookie cutter.</li>
<li>In a sauce pan over low heat, combine chocolate chips with ½ tbs of coconut and stir continuously until melted.</li>
<li><p>Drizzle chocolate (or topping of choice) over treats.</p>

<h1>Almond Thumbprint Cookies</h1>
<p><img src="2016-02-13-AlmondThumbprint/AlmondThumbprint1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s be honest, if it weren’t for Pinterest I would feel pretty indifferent about Valentine’s Day – but with more festive recipes than I could ever possibly scroll through and red &amp; pink DIYs galore, how can anyone resist?! For me, Valentine’s Day (or any other holiday, really) serves as a good excuse to stay in and put together something extra special in the kitchen. By special, I’m usually referring to sweets. I suffer from major sweet tooth, so for the most part, I try my best to keep sweets out of the house and refrain from making any… unless there’s a special occasion.</p>
<p>The recipe for these cookies is perhaps one of the most simple cookie recipes you will ever follow and its simplicity certainly does not compromise taste. I took some of these cookies to share at work a few days ago and they were quite a hit. The best part, if you ask me, is that they’re vegan. So that makes them healthy, right?</p>

<h1>Beet Burgers</h1>
<p><img src="2016-02-10-BeetBurgers/Beet1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Before I get to the beet burgers I will start off by saying, I’m really not good at this whole blogging thing. To be completely honest, I didn’t really expect the whole process to be as time consuming as it has turned out to be. By “the whole process,” I really do mean a whole process. This whole process involves quite a few steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The idea inception phase. Sometimes I have more ideas than others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once I have a great idea, finding the time to execute this great idea becomes a challenge. As I may have previously mentioned, I have a full-time job.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Testing out a recipe and shooting the whole process. Believe it or not, taking photos is a lot more time consuming (for me, at least) than it may seem. I would say that pretty much anything I cook takes about twice as long when there’s a camera involved. Additionally, there’s the time of the year to factor in. Natural daylight produces better images but because it’s winter, I can only take advantage of daylight hours over the weekend when I don’t work (sun sets ~5 PM).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Quality control. Let’s say I had a great idea, great light, and great photos. At that point, I just have to hope the final product is just as great. I’ve actually taken photos of recipes in the past but haven’t shared because I didn’t think they tasted great.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, editing and posting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not trying to throw myself a pity party over here. Just know that I’m working on it and I haven’t forgotten about this space.</p>
<p>Now… to the beet burgers. I’m sure by now you’ve gathered I’m a vegetarian. Actually, I’m (an almost full-time) vegan. I don’t like to say I’m a full-time vegan because I’m pretty sure I unknowingly eat traces of egg and milk (hidden ingredients in a lot of food) here and there that I don’t know about but for the most part, I try my best to stick to a vegan diet. Now, I’m not here to tell you why should be a vegetarian yourself or anything like that. My only hope is that these recipe posts inspire you to incorporate more plant-based recipes into your day-to-day. This recipe specifically was inspired by a beet burger I had last week at a local Denver restaurant . Beets weren’t exactly something I ate a whole lot of until recently that my husband and I moved from Texas to Colorado. Beets seem to be much more popular over here and I’m definitely not complaining. This beet patty has a great smoky tasty and is pretty easy to make. {Scroll down for full recipe.}</p>

<h1>Vegan Gingerbread Cookies</h1>
<p><img src="2016-02-04-GingerBreadCookies/GingerBread1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, this is embarrassing. I just saw the date stamp on my last post and cringed at the realization that my last post was published two months ago. Truth is, life’s been busy! October and November happened way too quickly and now I can’t believe December is also coming to an end. In the last two months, there’s been a lot of traveling to visit family and friends, adjusting to work life and living in a new state, and the list goes on. While I still haven’t struck the perfect balance between maintaining a full-time job and keeping up with this site, I am trying my best to be more consistent.</p>
<p>That being said, IT’S DECEMBER! Christmas is, without a doubt, my favorite time of the year. Thinking of all festive gatherings and activities, decorative lights and garlands, and bright white snow (now that we live in Colorado) only makes my heart warm. Baking up some delicious Christmas cookies is always an easy and fun way to get into the Christmas spirit. With that, there’s just something about a classic gingerbread cookie that screams Christmas to me. For those of you still looking for Christmas cookie recipe, this one is perfect. I actually made several dozens of these to share with family and friends. You can also get creative with the shape -I made a few Texas longhorn shaped ones (hook ’em horns!) and some Baylor bears for my mother-in-law. Give it a try and be sure to share with me how yours turn out!</p>
<p>Last but not least, I wish you and your loved ones a Merry Christmas. Enjoy!</p>

<li>Before rolling, let the dough sit at room temperature until it becomes softer and easier to roll.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 325 °F.</li>
<li>Roll the dough directly onto parchment paper. The dough should be approximately ¼” thick. Use cookie - cutters to cut out the dough.</li>

<li>Let them cool completely before decorating.</li>
<li>Beat all ingredients slowly adding the water in. (7-10 minutes at low speed with a heavy-duty mixer, - 10-12 minutes at high speed with a hand-held mixer).</li>
<li><ul>
<li>For a softer/chewy cookie, store in an airtight container or store in a container with some ventilation - for a crispier cookie.</li>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Welcome and thank you for stopping by!</p>
<p>It’s been a long time that I have entertained the idea of starting my own blog. My excuse for the last few years has been something along the lines of being a full-time student and having little to no free time to produce any content. Well, little did I know that having a full-time job meant giving up a substantially large portion of my free time. However, I can’t think of a better time to start than now.</p>
<p>Weekdays from nine to five, I am a transfer pricing associate at an accounting firm. I won’t bore you with the details of what that entails or give you a long-winded job description but, to give you an idea, I spend a lot of my day staring at financial data in Excel spreadsheets. Don’t get me wrong; I love finance, numbers, and Excel!</p>
<p>However, I am certain that my brain is equal parts right and left. My hopes are that this blog serves as a creative outlet where I can share the less-technical details of my day-to-day along with other things that I enjoy and inspire me. I’m excited to see how this grows and hope that you keep coming back for more!</p>
<p>– Corinna</p>
