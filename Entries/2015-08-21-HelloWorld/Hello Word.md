# Hello World

Welcome and thank you for stopping by!

It’s been a long time that I have entertained the idea of starting my own blog. My excuse for the last few years has been something along the lines of being a full-time student and having little to no free time to produce any content. Well, little did I know that having a full-time job meant giving up a substantially large portion of my free time. However, I can’t think of a better time to start than now.

Weekdays from nine to five, I am a transfer pricing associate at an accounting firm. I won’t bore you with the details of what that entails or give you a long-winded job description but, to give you an idea, I spend a lot of my day staring at financial data in Excel spreadsheets. Don’t get me wrong; I love finance, numbers, and Excel!

However, I am certain that my brain is equal parts right and left. My hopes are that this blog serves as a creative outlet where I can share the less-technical details of my day-to-day along with other things that I enjoy and inspire me. I’m excited to see how this grows and hope that you keep coming back for more!
