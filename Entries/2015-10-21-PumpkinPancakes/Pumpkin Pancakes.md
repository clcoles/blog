# Pumpkin Pancakes

![](./Pancakes1.jpg)

I suppose it is only appropriate that my first recipe post be one that pays a little tribute to my first real cooking accomplishment: pancakes. Not too long ago, the idea of me putting together a meal that required a little more skill than a bowl of cereal or a PB&J sounded quite absurd. If I remember correctly, my first real success at making pancakes was kind of a big deal –photos were taken to document this rare event in history.

Since then, I have grown a little more comfortable in the kitchen, to say the least. Comfortable enough to bring to you an improved, fall-inspired version of my first real cooking success. These pancakes are so good (and so easy to make) you won’t even know they’re vegan. Plus, who can say “no” to pumpkin anything in October? Scroll down to get the full recipe.
